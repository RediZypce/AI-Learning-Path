## Welcome!  
This repository is a structured collection of my journey in **AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning**.   

My goal is to create a comprehensive AI learning resource, complete with books, research papers, projects, and hands-on implementations I have completed through the years. Whether you're just getting started or getting into advanced areas like transformers and reinforcement learning, this repository should have something for you!
